# Food ordering system

This repository is intended to hold code, articles and annotations related to the development of a distributed, scalable, microservice-oriented food ordering system.

## What is this project for?

This project serves as a mental workout. This project aims to apply concepts of microservices, distributed systems, scalability, software architecture and patterns that are actively applied in the job market.

This project won't make you richer (unless you create something innovative that can beat iFood or DoorDash), but it will make you smarter (if you dedicate yourself properly).

## Project article

To give you a better understanding of this project, in parallel I wrote an article for it explaining each point, concept or technology covered in this project. Access the [article written by me](docs/article/Food_Ordering_System.pdf).

## References

Most of the references will be in the article I wrote.

When you open this project, it will probably be incomplete, as it is still under development. The README and documentation will be updated gradually.
